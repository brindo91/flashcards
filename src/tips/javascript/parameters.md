# Parameters

Parameters are placeholders defined in a function declaration to accept input values when the function is called. They act as variables inside the function, allowing you to pass data into it for processing. When the function is called, the values you pass are assigned to these parameters.

Default parameters allow you to set a default value for a functionâ€™s parameter, which is used if no argument is provided or if the argument is undefined.

When passing data when the function is invoked, these are known as arguments.
