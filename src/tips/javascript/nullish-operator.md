# Nullish coalescing operator

Nullish Coalescing Operator works with nullish values, not falsy values. This will evaluate <code>Null</code> or <code>Undefined</code> as falsy but treat <code>0</code> or <code>''</code> as truthy. Therefore, zero or empty strings are accepted.

It's good for working with default values.
