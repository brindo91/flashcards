# Method chaining

Method chaining is a programming pattern where multiple methods are called on the same array (or other supporting objects) in a single statement. Each method in the chain typically returns the object it was called on, enabling the subsequent method to be invoked on the same object.

The alternative to using method chaining in to have multiple variables stored on which to work with. This approach makes code more concise, readable and efficient. It is a sort of pipeline that processes the data.

In the course, the example is returning the sum of a list of deposits converted to another currency.
