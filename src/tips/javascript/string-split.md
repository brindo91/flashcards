# String split()

The <code>split()</code> method on strings separates a string into multiple items in an array. This method mainly takes a separator argument which specifies where the string should split. This is typically and space <code>split(' ')</code> or comma <code>split(',')</code>.

This can be useful for:

- Splitting up strings into individual words
- Breaking down complex strings like file paths or URLs
- Handling free user input such as items on a separate line of a text-area and converting to an array of items
