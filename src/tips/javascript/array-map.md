# Array .map()

The <code>.map()</code> method is used to transform a given array and create a new array (which is a shallow copy) of the results. It is ideal for tasks like formatting, calculations, or extracting properties from objects.

Example usages are:

- Converting a list of GBP values to USD
- Formatting an array of prices to add the currency to each price
- Calculations applied to each element of an array e.g. return 75% of each number
- Extracting specific properties from an object
- Abbreviating strings such as 'Monday' to 'Mon'
