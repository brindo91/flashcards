# Logical NOT

The logical NOT (<code>!</code>) operator is used to invert the truthiness of a value. It converts truthy values into false and falsy values into true. This operator is often used in conditional logic to check for the opposite of a condition or to ensure a value is explicitly falsy or truthy.
