# for...of loop

The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, or other iterables. It retrieves the values of the iterable in order, making it simpler to work with the contents directly compared to other loop types.

Unlike for...in, which works with object keys, for...of focuses solely on the values.
