# Switch statements

A switch statement is used to evaluate an expression against multiple possible cases, executing the code block for the first matching case. A <code>break</code> statement is typically used to stop further case evaluation. If no case matches, the default block (if present) runs.

Itâ€™s an alternative to writing multiple <code>if...else</code> conditions, making the code more organised.
