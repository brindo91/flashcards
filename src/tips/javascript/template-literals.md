# Template literals

When working with strings, template literals allow you to more easily build strings with variable references. They are constructed using backticks (<code>``</code>) and referencing variables or expressions can be done by wrapping with <code>${}</code>.

Template literals can be really powerful as you can also use expressions inside them to determine the result such as ternaries and calculations.

There is so much more that you can do with them such as:

- formatting numbers
- nesting ternaries
- multi-line strings
- dynamic functions
