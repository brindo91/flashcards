# Object methods

Object methods are functions stored as properties of an object. These methods are typically used to perform actions related to the object or manipulate its properties.
Object methods are powerful because they allow you to group data (properties) and behavior (methods) together, which makes it easier to model real-world entities in your code (encapsulation).
