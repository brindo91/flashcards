# Prefix increment

The <code>++</code> prefix operator is the pre-increment operator <code>++a</code> that increases the value of a variable by 1 <emphasis>before</emphasis> returning the value. This is different from the post-increment operator <code>a++</code>, which returns the <emphasis>original value</emphasis> first before incrementing.

Pre-increment is useful when you need the updated value immediately; Post-increment is useful when you need the old value before updating.
