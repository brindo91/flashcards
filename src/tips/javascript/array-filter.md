# Array .filter()

The <code>.filter()</code> method is used to create a new array (which is a shallow copy) with only the elements of the original array that meet a certain condition.

This can be used to filter things like numbers based on them being greater than x, strings that meet a criteria (e.g. <code>startsWith('m')</code>), strings that are shorter than 6 characters and objects based on their properties (e.g. user that have <code>isActive: true</code>).
