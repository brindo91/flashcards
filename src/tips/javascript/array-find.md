# Array find()

The <code>find()</code> is an iterative method is used to search for the first element in an array that matches a condition and then returns that element. If no match is found, it returns <code>undefined</code>. It uses a callback to evaluate each item in the array to determine if it meets a specified condition.

If you want to return all matches rather than just the first one, use <code>filter()</code> instead.
