# Abstraction

Abstraction is about hiding the complexity of a system and exposing only the essential parts that you need to work with. It allows you to focus on what a program does rather than how it does it.

When you drive a car, you donâ€™t need to know how the engine works internally. Instead, you interact with simple controls like the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake.
