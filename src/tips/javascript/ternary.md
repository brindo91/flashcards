# Ternaries

A ternary operator is a concise way to write an <code>if...else</code> statement. It has the syntax: <code>condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse</code>. If the condition is true, the first expression executes; otherwise, the second one does. It’s useful for simple conditions and makes the code more compact.
