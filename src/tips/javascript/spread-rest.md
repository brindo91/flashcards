# Spread & Rest operators

Both of these operators use the same <code>...</code> syntax but have different usages.

The spread operator allows you to unpack or <i>spread</i> arrays, objects, strings, maps or sets.

It can serve the following purposes:

- Cloning arrays or objects by creating a brand new shallow copy that does not affect the original.
- Combining/merging one or more arrays or objects into a brand new variable.
- Expanding strings, since strings are essentially arrays of letters.
