# if...else statements

An <code>ifâ€¦else</code> statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block if the condition is false. You can nest statements together when there are multiple conditions using <code>else if</code> and then use <code>else</code> to finish.

The condition doesn't have to be a comparison (<code>===</code>, for example), it can be any value and JavaScript will determine the outcome based on whether it is truthy or falsy.

You can use:

- <code>&&</code> (AND)
- <code>||</code> (OR)
- <code>!</code> (NOT)
- <code>??</code> (Nullish coalescing)
- <code>%</code> (Modulus)
- and more...
