# Shallow and deep copies

In programming, values are stored in variables. Making a copy means you initiated a new variable with the same value(s).

A deep copy means that all of the values of the new variable are copied and disconnected from the original variable. A shallow copy means that certain (sub-)values are still connected to the original variable.

With primitives, this is pretty straight forward.
