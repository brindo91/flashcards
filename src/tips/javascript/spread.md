# Spread operator

The spread (<code>...</code>) operator allows you to unpack or “spread” an iterable (arrays, strings, maps or sets) into individual elements. Objects are not literals but, since ES2018, spread works with objects too.

It can serve the following purposes:

- Cloning arrays or objects by creating a brand new shallow copy that does not affect the original.
- Combining/merging one or more arrays or objects into a brand new variable.
- Expanding strings, since strings are essentially arrays of letters.
