# YAGNI

The YAGNI principle stands for “You Ain’t Gonna Need It” and is a key concept in software development. It encourages developers to only implement what is immediately necessary and avoid adding features or functionality that are not currently required.

In summary, YAGNI reminds developers to avoid solving problems that don’t exist yet. Build what’s needed now, and adapt when new needs arise.
